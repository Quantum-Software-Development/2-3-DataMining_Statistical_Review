| 1. Find the midpoint of each class. | \$ x = \frac{lower limit + upper limit}{2} \$ |
| 2. Multiply each midpoint by its class frequency and sum the results. | \$ \sum (x \cdot f) \$ |
| 3. Find the sum of all frequencies. | \$ n = \sum f \$ |
| 4. Calculate the mean by dividing the sum from step 2 by step 3. | \$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum (x \cdot f)}{n} \$ |

## Example: Finding the Mean of a Frequency Distribution

Use the frequency distribution below to approximate the average number of minutes that a sample of internet users spent connected in their last session.


| Class | Midpoint ($x$) | Frequency ($f$) |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| 7 – 18 | 12.5 | 6 |
| 19 – 30 | 24.5 | 10 |
| 31 – 42 | 36.5 | 13 |
| 43 – 54 | 48.5 | 8 |
| 55 – 66 | 60.5 | 5 |
| 67 – 78 | 72.5 | 6 |
| 79 – 90 | 84.5 | 2 |

Let's compute the products and their sum:


| Class | Midpoint ($x$) | Frequency ($f$) | $x \cdot f$ |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 7 – 18 | 12.5 | 6 | 75.0 |
| 19 – 30 | 24.5 | 10 | 245.0 |
| 31 – 42 | 36.5 | 13 | 474.5 |
| 43 – 54 | 48.5 | 8 | 388.0 |
| 55 – 66 | 60.5 | 5 | 302.5 |
| 67 – 78 | 72.5 | 6 | 435.0 |
| 79 – 90 | 84.5 | 2 | 169.0 |
| **Total** |  | **50** | **2089.0** |

Therefore, the mean is:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum (x \cdot f)}{n} = \frac{2089}{50} \approx 41.8 \text{ minutes}
$$

# Shapes of Distributions

## Symmetrical Distribution

- A vertical line can be drawn at the middle of the graph, and the halves are nearly identical.

***

## Uniform Distribution (Rectangular)

- All entries have equal or nearly equal frequencies.
- The distribution is symmetric.

***

## Left-Skewed Distribution (Negatively Skewed)

- The "tail" of the graph extends more to the left.
- The mean is to the left of the median.

***

## Right-Skewed Distribution (Positively Skewed)

- The "tail" of the graph extends more to the right.
- The mean is to the right of the median.

# Finding the Weighted Mean

Sometimes, the mean is calculated considering different "weights" for each value.

**Example:**

A student's grade is determined based on 5 sources:

- 50% for the average of exams
- 15% for the midterm exam
- 20% for the final exam
- 10% for computer lab work
- 5% for homework

Suppose your grades are:

- Exam average: 86
- Midterm: 96
- Final Exam: 82
- Lab: 98
- Homework: 100


## Weighted Mean Calculation Table

| Source | Grade ($x$) | Weight ($w$) | $x \cdot w$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Exam Average | 86 | 0.50 | 43.0 |
| Midterm | 96 | 0.15 | 14.4 |
| Final Exam | 82 | 0.20 | 16.4 |
| Lab | 98 | 0.10 | 9.8 |
| Homework | 100 | 0.05 | 5.0 |
| **Sum** |  | **1** | **88.6** |

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum (x \cdot w)}{\sum w} = \frac{88.6}{1} = 88.6
$$

So, the student did **not** get an A (minimum required is 90).

# Mean of Grouped Data

The mean of a frequency distribution is calculated as:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum (x \cdot f)}{n}
$$

Where $x$ is the class midpoint and $f$ is the frequency of the class.
