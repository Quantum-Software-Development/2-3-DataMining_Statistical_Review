## [Key Topics Covered]()

<br>

### [1](). Frequency Distribution

A **frequency distribution** is a table that shows classes or intervals of data with a count of the number of entries in each class. It's fundamental for understanding data patterns and is the foundation for creating histograms.

<br> 

#### [Components]():

- **Class limits**: Lower and upper boundaries of each class
- **Class size**: The width of each class interval
- **Frequency (f)**: Number of data entries in each class
- **Relative frequency**: Proportion of data in each class (f/n)
- **Cumulative frequency**: Sum of frequencies up to a given class
